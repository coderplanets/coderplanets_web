/*
 *
 * F: stands for GraphQL Fragments
 *    NOTE: well, this is not real GraphQL-Fragments, just some comment pices
 *    used across the containers / pages, it's enoungh for now
 *
 *    the reason is graphql-request semms not support gql`` tag , which is used
 *    by fragment staff, it hurt me so bad
 *
 * P: stands for schemas used by nextjs pages, also counld be used in page-containers
 *    like: PostBanner ..
